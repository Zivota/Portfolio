        <p>
          Besides my love for technology and programming, I am a communicative
          and friendly person who loves spending time with friends or meeting
          new people.
          <br /> In my free time, I like watching movies and reading books,
          mostly science fiction, or playing video games. Also, I am huge coffe
          (and beer) lover. Cheers üç∫.

        <h2>Let's work together!</h2>
        <p>
          In the business field, I find myself a very well-organized,
          responsible, and reliable person. I am curious and willing to learn
          from more experienced devs as well as explore and find a solution on
          my own.
